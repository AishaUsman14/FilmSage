Project Title: FilmSage - Movie Recommendation Website Application with Integrated AI Chatbot\

Additionally, the app will guide users to available streaming platforms, like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HULU, YouTube TV, and others, where they can watch the recommended movies. The application will also include an admin role for managing user profiles, overseeing app-related information, and maintaining data integrity.\
